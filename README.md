# Classic Mechanics
## By Wilozyx


Classic mechanics is a datapack I've made in the past and kind of abandoned up until recently, when I decided to revisit and upload it. 
The goal of this datapack is to re-insert older features, tweaks and mechanics of the game into modern minecraft, this includes various things from beta, alpha, infdev, indev, classic, early release, etc. 

(Note: As this was done by, a more inexperienced, past me (hate that guy), this datapack is not currently in a state where I would be proud of it really. Currently, its more of a display piece than anything, I really do wanna redo a lot of this pack and will probably do so in the near future)

The datapack comes with 'modules' - each one is a different tweak/feature/mechanic, all of them are toggle-able/configurable at any time and are only ever active if enabled, to preserve game performance.

Remember that all modules are _disabled by default_! To enable them you must type in the command for the options/config message (listed below)

The options message contains a button you can click to see which modules are enabled/disabled, aswell as all modules, with the minecraft versions they were added and removed on

**Config/Options message command:**

```
/function classic_mechanics:options_message
```





## **-> NOTE**
This datapack aims to be compatible with several other types of datapacks, meaning, it purposefully does not touch things like world/terrain generation and actively tries other, different methods for results that would require such a thing!
